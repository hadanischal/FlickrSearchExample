# FlickrSearchExample
Objective:
Build a basic image viewer app that allows the user to find and view images from Flickr.

Instructions:
On launch, users should be taken to a home screen that automatically displays geographically- relevant results based on their current location.
Users should be able to supply a search term to receive results related to that search term.
Users should be able to filter results by available tags, or perform a follow-on search using a tag as a search term.
The app needs to asynchronously present the results as thumbnails on a grid
The images should be cached properly (in memory and on disk).
The user should be able to tap on a thumbnail to view the image in its entirety, with   metadata displayed on-screen (e.g., image name, size, resolution, date, etc.).
There should be unit tests to cover the core functionality of the app. 

Expectations
The code written by yourself must be Swift.
You have complete control over UX and UI. 
It is strongly recommended that your app conforms closely to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines, and is optimised for performance.
The app should be a native app constructed in Xcode, leveraging what’s available in the iOS SDK. Creation of a web wrapper and executing on the aforementioned requirements in a web page is not permitted.
Please ensure that the app is compatible with all sizes of iPhone and iPad. It is acceptable for the app to only support iOS 11.
Please use the Flickr API (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) and make direct requests to the API.
Usage of other third-party APIs/libraries/frameworks is not permitted. 

Submission Guidelines
Provide a copy of the codebase to us via your preferred method. The project should not be tied to any developer accounts, and needs to be able to be built by our technical team for running in a simulator/device.
