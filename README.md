# FlickrSearchExample

## Requirements:
* iOS 11.0+
* Xcode 9.4.1
* Swift 4.1

## Objective:
Build a basic image viewer app that allows the user to search and view images from Flickr API.

## Specification
*  Please build an IPhone app that uses the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) and make direct requests to the API.

## Instructions:
* On launch, users should be taken to a home screen that automatically displays geographically- relevant results based on their current location.
* Users should be able to supply a search term to receive results related to that search term.
* Users should be able to filter results by available tags, or perform a follow-on search using a tag as a search term.
* The app needs to asynchronously present the results as thumbnails on a grid
* The images should be cached properly (in memory and on disk).
* The user should be able to tap on a thumbnail to view the image in its entirety,
with 􏰀 metadata displayed on-screen (e.g., image name, size, resolution, date,
etc.).
* There should be unit tests to cover the core functionality of the app.

## Expectations:
* The code written by yourself must be Swift.
* You have complete control over UX and UI.
* It is strongly recommended that your app conforms closely to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines, and is optimised for performance.
* The app should be a native app constructed in Xcode, leveraging what’s available in the iOS SDK. 
* Creation of a web wrapper and executing on the aforementioned requirements in a web page is not permitted.
* Please ensure that the app is compatible with all sizes of iPhone and iPad. 
* It is acceptable for the app to only support iOS 11.
* Usage of other third-party APIs/libraries/frameworks is not permitted.

## Additional Requirements
* Focus on code quality, architecture and efficiency in this exercise.
* Add unit tests
* Your resulting app running on an iDevice of your choice
* A github repo that we can look at to see your code base
* The project should not be tied to any developer accounts.
* Needs to be able to be built by our technical team for running in a simulator/device.
